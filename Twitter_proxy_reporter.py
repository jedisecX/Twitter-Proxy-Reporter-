Twitter Proxy Reporter

This Python script automates logging into multiple Twitter accounts using proxies and Tweepy, aiming to report spam accounts efficiently. Each login rotates through a list of proxies to avoid detection and enhance privacy.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Tweepy

Requests


Installation

Install dependencies using pip:

pip install tweepy requests

Configuration

Proxies

Update the proxies list with your proxy URLs.

Twitter API Credentials

Update the accounts list with your Twitter API credentials:

consumer_key

consumer_secret

access_token

access_token_secret


Target Username

Specify the username of the Twitter account you wish to report in the target_username variable.

Usage

Run the script:

python twitter_proxy_reporter.py

Note

The script currently demonstrates the logic and proxy rotation. Twitter API v2 doesn't directly expose user-reporting capabilities, so the reporting functionality shown here is illustrative. For production use, consider browser automation tools like Selenium or Playwright for actual reporting tasks.
